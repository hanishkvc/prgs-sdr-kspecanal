While design of a product, one is interested in understanding

* what and all frequency emissions are there from a given product
  and or at a given location in the product.

  Kind of probe/antenna used and at what distance, helps decide
  the locality or globality of the study results.

* how changing some aspect of the design or its setup inturn improves
  or worsens the situation. Relative study is good enough at one level.


So using a full-samplingrate-width window based overlapped sliding with
max mode amplitude capture over multisecond data in each freq band being
scanned, potentially using rectangle window function, can give a picture
of what frequencies are at play. And potentially to what max amplitude
levels.

While running the same with a reduced fft window size and sliding, will
allow one to scan through with less fidelity in a fast way.

And using water-fall/heat-map view of fft outputs of smoothing windowed
(hanning/kaiser) data, as one slides over the full data in a overlapped
manner, looking at a subset of the data at each given step, should help
guage how the frequencies involved are coming and going out of existance
with time.

ie getting a rought picture of all the frequencies involved and to what
relative amplitude levels and how they roughly change relatively on their
own and with changes to design or setup is what this tries to give at a
simple level. It doesnt go into nitty gritties beyond it.

It is a study in rough relatives and not absolutes,
and that is good enough / sufficiently useful, many a times ;-)

One can mix and match the options supported by the program to try and
explore the emissions/signals in a suitable way.


Use
#####

Supports two scan modes

Zero Span
===========

kspecanal.py zeroSpan centerFreq <theFreq>

This scans a frequency band centered at centerFreq, and spread over a
band width of 2.4MHz (decided based on the sampling rate limit of rtlsdr),
again and again.

It shows the normalised fft result magnitudes of the scan on a Log scale.

It also shows a heatmap | waterfall of the signal levels over a period of
time till then.


Scan
=======

Scan over a large freq range, in steps and show the results both as a
normal signal level plot as well as a heat map with historic data.

Normal
--------

kspecanal.py scan startFreq <theStartFreq> endFreq <theEndFreq>

One can specify a frequency range over which to scan. If the specified
range is larger than what is supported by the hardware in one go, then
it will step through the specified range, in steps.

The normalised fft result is clipped wrt low values (so that the noise
can be clipped to some extent) and then shown on a log scale.

QuickFullScan
---------------

kspecanal.py quickFullScan

is a alias for

        kspecanal.py scan startFreq 30e6 endFreq 1.5e9 fftSize 256

i.e this triggers a quick scan from 30e6 to 1.5e9 with fftSize of 256


NOTE
=======

Currently the logic is setup to apply fft on 2**14 samples at a time,
this gives a fft bin width / RBW of around 150Hz for 2.4e6 sampling rate.

There is processing and plotting delay between the repeating scans, so
any signal occuring at that time will be lost. Similarly when using scan
to scan through a large freq range (especially when doing beyond 2.4MHz
band) at any given time only a freq band equivalent to samplingRate is
what is being monitored, so any signals occuring in any other bands at
that time will not be captured.

Other Args
-----------

samplingRate <samplingRateFloat>

        Default 2.4e6; this is a good value for rtlsdr. If you want,
        you can reduce it.

minAmp4Clip <float>

        Default (1/256)*0.33; Change it to control the forced noise floor.
        Any measured signal level below this in the freq domain will be
        set to this value.

gain <gainFloat>

        Default 19.1; Increase or reduce this depending on the strength
        of the signals being studied.

cumuMode <Avg|Max|Copy>

        Default Avg; Change to Max, if one wants to know the max value
        noticed at any time during the scan.

window <true|false>

        Default: False; Controls whether a windowing function (hanning)
        is applied to the time domain samples, before fft is done. Helps
        get a better sense about the signals in a scan. Useful if only
        a limited scan is being done. However for small fft window size,
        overlapped sliding may be more useful.

fftSize <integer>

        Default: 2**14; The number of samples that is run through the fft
        in one go. This also decides the resolution bandwidth of the logic.
        Larger the fftSize, finer the freq resolution.

nonOverlap <float>

        Default: 0.1; As the small size fft window is slide over a larger
        signal sample dataset, this controls how much of the data is
        skipped during the overlapping. 0.1 means 90% overlapping 1.0
        means 0% overlapping. Overlapping normally helps get a better feel of
        the signal level, even thou only a fraction of a second worth of data
        is run through fft at a time.

bPltLevels <true|false>

        Default: True; Control whether the current internal scan signal level
        is plotted or not. Disabling this will speed up the scan interval a bit.

bPltHeatMap <true|false>

        Default: True; Control whether the signal level history | heat map is
        plotted or not. Disabling this will speed up the scan interval a bit.

nonOverlapScanRange <float>

        Default: 0.75; Change to control how much of the freq band is overlapped
        as the scan range logic scans/steps through a given range of frequencies.
        Set it to 1.0 to avoid overlapping, or set it to 0.5 to overlap 50% of the
        freq band, as the logic tunes to the next center freq to scan the next
        adjacent freq band. Could help overcome any non linearity in measuring
        within a freq band, to an extent.

prgLoopCnt <int>

        Default: A large value; Change to a smaller value, if you want to scan
        for a short amount of time like few minutes or so. As zooming or panning
        the plot, when the program is running and updating the plot is not easy
        and consistent, so one can scan for a short time, and then once the scan
        is finished look into the scan plot in detail, or else one will have to
        wait till the program stops after a long time.

Remember
----------

Do look into the source to get the latest | current default setting for the
different options, and or to change as one sees fit.


TODO
#######

Account -ve freqs of complex iq fft. [Done]

Put something similar to old dwelltime, but controlled using rbw
rather than dwell time. Along with windowing and some amount of limited
sliding. [5050]

Add Max based cumulation of fft result and provide option to switch
between average and Max [Done].

Add the running heatmap/waterfall view [Done].

Overlap across scan bands [Done].

Use pygame or cairo or .. to do the plots. Heatmap with large freq bands and
default or large fftSize, could bring the program and the system to its knees.
